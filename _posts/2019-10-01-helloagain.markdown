After a year and plus long hiatus, back with some updates, e.g. the photos page.


### Life


I adopted a plant-based diet last summer and happy to say that I have no regrets.

I vacationed in Colorado and Long Island, NY for the first time as well as Europe twice. Both trips to Europe were eye opening experiences that changed my view of the world and the role of the individual.

### Reading

Der Klang der Familie by Felix Denk and Sven von Th√ºlen continued to satisfy my curiosity about the culture surrounding techno music after a "supplemental" visit to Berlin. It was great to read about the origins of the DIY underground spirit and be validated for having almost identical feelings that the generation before had compared to ones from discovering these experiences on my own. 


### Tunes


NTS and dublab
