I finally created a personal website. I followed Programming Historian's lesson, [Building a static website with Jekyll and Github Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#on-windows-). The tutorial was concise and easy to follow. It was the perfect starting point for someone like me who had no prior web development experience.


I aim to keep this site up to date by adding new content and more character as I continue Googling how to code stuff.


### Tunes


I'm bouncing between Brian Eno's [Music for Installations](https://open.spotify.com/album/3z6IlwN9dnSMNXDI2nMbfq?si=0ILGkymATsivdlwVXQrNnQ), DJ Koze's [Knock Knock](https://open.spotify.com/album/0sT4nyNxsvGNQr1O8OR83O?si=k3Idwjv1T7y5HboIGneUXA), a cheesy playlist I compiled of Prince's music taste, and autechre's glorious NTS Sessions 1-4.


### Life


First time in Texas was lovely - filled with delicious eats, kind souls, and cool art in hellishly hot air. Would love to explore more of Dallas and Austin eventually.

Its peculiar that life has patterns in subtle ways and still manages to feel unnervingly new. Life's big pictures are a constant backdrop to every day.
