I finally created a personal website. I followed Programming Historian's lesson, [Building a static website with Jekyll and Github Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#on-windows-). The tutorial was clear and concise, thorough yet simple. It was the perfect starting point for someone like me who had no prior web development experience.


I aim to keep this site up to date by adding new content and more character as I continue Googling how to code stuff.


### Tunes


I'm bouncing between Brian Eno's [Music for Installations](https://open.spotify.com/album/3z6IlwN9dnSMNXDI2nMbfq?si=0ILGkymATsivdlwVXQrNnQ), DJ Koze's [Knock Knock](https://open.spotify.com/album/0sT4nyNxsvGNQr1O8OR83O?si=k3Idwjv1T7y5HboIGneUXA), a cheesy playlist I compiled of Prince's music taste, and autechre's glorious NTS Sessions 1-4.


### Life


First ever Texas vacation was lovely - filled with delicious eats, kind souls, and cool art in hellishly hot air. Definitely want to explore more of Dallas and Austin eventually.

Interesting that life seems to repeat its patterns in subtle ways and still manage to feel unnervingly new. Life's big pictures are just a backdrop.
