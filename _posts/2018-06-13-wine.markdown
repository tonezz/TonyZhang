My first Python script uses the BeautifulSoup package to extract HTML data from TotalWine.com.

# [total-wine-scraper](https://github.com/tonezz/total-wine-scraper)

The first revision collects the data from all red wines available on the online store that contains all the requested HTML data elements:


* Wine name

* Price

* Country/state

* Region

* Product type (red/white)

* Varietal type

* Description


Some elements of the data request are hardcoded in the first revision of the script, e.g. type of wine (red/white) and price of wine, that I have plans to make user-configurable from the command line. There are also two intermittent issues; timing out when requesting URLs and running into MemoryError when collecting on >50 pages or more.


The script was able to collect the data of close to 1,600 different red wine products off of the TotalWine website. I plan on using this data to explore more capabilities in Python.


Overall, it was a great introduction to developing with Python, working with Python packages, and website HTML data. The experience was exciting and the lightweight factor was definitely enjoyable.


Any feedback would be graciously accepted! :rainbow: :grin:
