I"ˆ<p>I finally created a personal website. I followed Programming Historianâ€™s lesson, <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#on-windows-">Building a static website with Jekyll and Github Pages</a>. The tutorial was concise and easy to follow. It was the perfect starting point for someone like me who had no prior web development experience.</p>

<p>I aim to keep this site up to date by adding new content and more character as I continue Googling how to code stuff.</p>

<h3 id="tunes">Tunes</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m bouncing between Brian Enoâ€™s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3z6IlwN9dnSMNXDI2nMbfq?si=0ILGkymATsivdlwVXQrNnQ">Music for Installations</a>, DJ Kozeâ€™s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0sT4nyNxsvGNQr1O8OR83O?si=k3Idwjv1T7y5HboIGneUXA">Knock Knock</a>, a cheesy playlist I compiled of Princeâ€™s music taste, and autechreâ€™s glorious NTS Sessions 1-4.</p>

<h3 id="life">Life</h3>

<p>First time in Texas was lovely - filled with delicious eats, kind souls, and cool art in hellishly hot air. Would love to explore more of Dallas and Austin eventually.</p>

<p>Its peculiar that life has patterns in subtle ways and still manages to feel unnervingly new. Lifeâ€™s big pictures are a constant backdrop to every day.</p>
