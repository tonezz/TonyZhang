I followed Programming Historianâ€™s lesson, <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#on-windows-">Building a static website with Jekyll and Github Pages</a>. The tutorial was concise and easy to follow. It was the perfect starting point for someone like me who had no prior web development experience.</p>
