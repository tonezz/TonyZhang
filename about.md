Hello, I'm Tony.


I'm engineering automated software testing solutions for ultrasound systems at [Philips Healthcare](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/ultrasound).


I'm interested in gaining more experience in different programming languages and tools. I hope to contribute to open-source project and ultimately submit my own experiments.


Outside of learning programming, I also enjoy art, nature, and exercise.
