Hello, I'm Tony.


I'm developing automated software testing solutions in C# for [Philips Healthcare](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/ultrasound)'s ultrasound systems.


I'm interested in gaining experience in other programming languages and tools for contributing to open-source projects and ultimately submitting my own experiments.


Outside of learning programming, I also enjoy art, nature, and exercise.
